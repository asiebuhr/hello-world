# Hi everyone!!!

I'm an aspiring data analyst and scientist, interested in analysing data regarding greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy projects. I received my BSc in Environmental Economics and Policy from UC Berkeley.

## Currently

I am currently working on a project tracking solar power production for a local electric utility. I also have a small project that analyzes the income level of each census tract of the jurisdiction I'm in and how that correlates with the amount of solar in each tract.
