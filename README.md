# hello-world
I'm an aspiring data and climate scientist, interested in analysing data regarding greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy projects. I received my BSc in Environmental Economics and Policy from UC Berkeley and currently work to create a GHG and energy efficiency tracking program for a joint-power authority.
