# Hi everyone!!!

I'm an aspiring data analyst and scientist, interested in analysing data regarding greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy projects. I received my BSc in Environmental Economics and Policy from UC Berkeley.

## Past

I received my BSc in Environmental Economics and Policy from UC Berkeley in 2016. While looking for work I became unenthused by my major (which I was already sick of while earning it) and I picked up R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund a year later. I've always had an interest in climate and energy policy & science, so I decided to apply what I knew about R to those topics. Now I aim to teach myself Python to learn the same things.

## Currently

I am currently working on a project tracking solar power production for a local electric utility. I also have a small project that analyzes the income level of each census tract of the jurisdiction I'm in and how that correlates with the amount of solar in each tract.
